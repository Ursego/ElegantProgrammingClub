The result is simpler, clearer code—even in very complex systems—and makes understanding, debugging, and maintaining enterprise applications much easier.

The ancient maxim "divide et impera" proved a potent tool for emperors seeking to maintain control over vast and often disparate territories.
By strategically fostering divisions among potentially powerful factions, be it through playing on existing rivalries or creating new ones, emperors could prevent unified opposition
	from forming, thus weakening any threats to their authority and ensuring their continued rule.
This principle of breaking down large, complex entities into smaller, more manageable parts finds a compelling parallel in programming.
The "divide and conquer" paradigm in software involves breaking down a large, intricate problem into smaller, independent subproblems that are easier to solve individually.
Once these smaller solutions are obtained, they are combined to solve the original, more complex problem.
This approach not only simplifies the development process but also often leads to more efficient and maintainable code.

A BIG PROGRAM SHOULD ALWAYS BE WRITTEN IN SMALL PIECES

If your executable sections stretch across hundreds of lines—with a loop starting on page 2 and ending on page 6—it becomes nearly impossible to follow the function's logic and see the full picture of what’s going on.

So even if an overgrown fragment of a function is executed only once, extract it into its own function—don’t wait for it to be reused in more than one place
(though reuse is a good reason too—see https://github.com/Ursego/ElegantProgrammingClub/blob/main/Avoid%20code%20duplication.cs).

KEEP ALL OF THE OPERATIONS IN A METHOD AT THE SAME LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION

This will naturally result in programs with many small methods.
Programming is all about managing complexity, and short one-purpose functions make it easier to do that.

The more lines in a method, the harder it is to understand what it does, so it’s very difficult to grasp the logic behind one massive, tangled, toilet-paper-long method.
To figure out what’s going on, a developer is forced to read a messy mix of code—all jumbled together, even though the logic clearly belongs to different abstraction levels.

THE STEP-WISE REFINEMENT (AKA "TOP-DOWN DECOMPOSITION") PRINCIPLE

It's simple: don’t dive into all the details immediately!
Instead, start with a the top-level ("main") function. It should resemble the table of contents of the book, not its main text.
That main function should call clearly named sub-functions, which can themselves call sub-sub-functions, and so on.
This hierarchy lets developers "travel" up and down through abstraction levels, always focusing on just one level at a time.
The result is that at any given level of refinement, you can fully understand the logic at that level without being overwhelmed.

To get a general idea of what’s going on, it’s usually enough to look at the top-level function.
You’ll dig into the sub-functions only if absolutely necessary—and in most cases, you won’t need to if the sub-functions have quality names.
So why clutter your view with code that’s rarely needed to be investigated, especially if it hides the "big picture"?
